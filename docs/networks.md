# Networks

Bitlike provides support for the main cryptocurrencies.

The `Network` namespace has a function, `get(...)` that returns an instance of a `Network` or `undefined`. The only argument to this function is some kind of identifier of the network: either its name, a reference to a Network object, or a number used as a magic constant to identify the network.

## Network constants

The functionality of testnet and livenet is mostly similar (except for some relaxed block validation rules on testnet). They differ in the constants being used for human representation of base58 encoded strings. These are sometimes referred to as "version" constants.
